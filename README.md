# Video Cropper FFMPEG 100% generated with a single ChatGPT o1-preview prompt

This is a desktop application built with **Electron** and **FFmpeg** that allows users to visually select a crop area from the video before converting, and progress is displayed during the conversion process.

## Features
- **Video Preview**: Load an MP4 file and preview it within the app.
- **Crop Selection**: Manually select the area of the video to crop by dragging a selection box.
- **Progress Tracking**: A progress bar indicates the conversion process in real-time.
- **Cropping with Scaling**: The crop area is scaled correctly to match the original video resolution.

## How to Install and Run the App

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: Install Node.js (https://nodejs.org/)
- **FFmpeg**: Install FFmpeg on your system and make sure it is accessible from the command line (https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).

### Steps to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/video-converter-app.git
   cd video-converter-app
   ```

2. Install the dependencies using npm:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the application:

### Building the App (Optional)
To package the app into a distributable format:
1. Install **electron-builder**:
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev electron-builder
   ```

2. Build the app:
